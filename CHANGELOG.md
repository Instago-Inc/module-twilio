## v1.0.1 - Refine Twilio docs and deps

Streamlined the Twilio README and dependency references so SMS setup instructions stay actionable and up to date for Instago developers.  Runtime references now point to the latest bundled HTTP/log helpers so the workflow reflects current tooling.

### Changed
- Clarified usage guidance, configuration notes, and examples for the V8-focused Twilio helper.
- Updated code comments and runtime requirements to use the latest HTTP and log helpers instead of pinned 1.0.0 builds.
